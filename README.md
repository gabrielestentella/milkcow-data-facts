## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

This dataset, sourced from the USDA, provides comprehensive insights into U.S. dairy production, consumption, and economic factors. It includes five key datasets covering different aspects of the dairy industry:  

1. **milkcow_facts.csv** – Contains yearly data on milk cow numbers, milk production per cow, total production, pricing, and economic factors like feed costs and cow prices.  
2. **fluid_milk_sales.csv** – Tracks annual sales of different milk types in pounds.  
3. **milk_products_facts.csv** – Provides per capita consumption data for various dairy products.  
4. **clean_cheese.csv** – Focuses on cheese consumption trends, detailing various cheese types such as Cheddar, Mozzarella, Swiss, and processed cheeses.  
5. **state_milk_production.csv** – Records annual milk production at the state level, categorized by region.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

This visualization project will explore the evolving trends in milk production, dairy consumption, and pricing in the United States. The goal is to analyze changes in milk production, consumer preferences, and economic factors affecting the dairy industry. The main axis of the project will be how milk and dairy product consumption has shifted over time, how this relates to production levels, and what economic factors may be influencing these trends.

#### Motivation for the Project
This project aims to provide insights into how the industry is evolving and whether traditional dairy consumption is being replaced by other food trends.

#### Project overview
We aim to provide answers about the following aspects:
- Production and Consumption Trends:
    - How has U.S. milk production changed over the years?
    - What are the trends in milk consumption per capita?
- Regional & State-Level Production Analysis:
    - Which states produce the most milk, and how has production shifted over time?
    - Are there regional patterns in milk production growth or decline?
- Cheese & Dairy Product Consumption Patterns:
    - How has cheese consumption evolved, and what types of cheese are most popular?
- Pricing Analysis:
    - How do milk prices correlate with production levels?
    - What is the relationship between dairy cow costs, feed costs, and milk prices?

#### Target Audience
- General public & consumers interested in food trends and how their choices impact the dairy industry.
- Policymakers & agricultural economists examining the sustainability and economic shifts in dairy farming.
- Dairy industry professionals & farmers tracking production, pricing, and demand patterns.
- Students & researchers looking for data-driven insights into agricultural economics and food consumption trends.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

A introductory exploration of the dataset is provided in this [notebook](milestone_1.ipynb).
Each cell shows a specific aspect of the data through a table or a graph, summarizing the basic statistics that one could access when encountering the dataset for the first time. We also tried to answer basic questions such as "which are the top 10 states in milk production".

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
